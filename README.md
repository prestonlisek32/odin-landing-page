## Out-take
The design does not look exactly like the odin design, nor is it exactly responsive, especially on small screens. However, this project made me a lot more comfortable with flexbox and the box model of html elements. I plan to re-visit this project later on to follow the original design better and to make it more responive, while also trying to use more semantic html and make it accessible.
